# Casablanca (GMMN)

### Aerodrome Description

With just under 8 million passengers passing through the airport in 2014, it was the busiest airport in Morocco and the fourth busiest in Africa. In August 2014, ONDA reported a year-on-year increase of 7.28% passenger traffic, to 918,238. The airport serves as hub for Royal Air Maroc, Royal Air Maroc Express and Air Arabia Maroc. It is named after King Mohammed V of Morocco, who led the country's successful push for independence from French and Spanish colonial rule.

## Mohammed V Ground

### General Provisions

<p>The SMC controller’s callsign, for radio communication and coordination, is “Mohammed 5th Ground”.</p>

<p>The SMC controller is the first station for all departing aircraft (IFR/VFR) to call and is responsible for operations on the surface of Mohammed V International Airport, such as pushback/engine start-up, repositioning and taxi.</p>

### En Route Clearance and Start-up

<p>To prevent any unnecessary delays, pilots are provided with their start-up clearance along with their en route clearance. This clearance should conform to the following format and each of the following items must be read back.</p>

<p>An IFR clearance shall be in the following format:</p>

- Callsign;
- Destination;
- Departure procedure;
- Initially cleared altitude;
- SSR code

<blockquote>
<div class="text">
  <p>
  <span style="color:rgb(150,0,0);">RAM810D:</span>&emsp;
  <span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20);">"Mohammed 5th Delivery, Royal Air Maroc 810 Delta, information charlie, request start-up clearance to Frankfurt."</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <span style="color: rgb(150, 0, 0);">GMMN_DEL:</span>&emsp;
  <span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 Delta, Mohammed 5th Delivery, start-up approved, cleared to Frankfurt, TOLSI3D departure, climb initally FL50, squawk 6403."</span>
  </p>

  <p><span style="color:rgb(150,0,0);">RAM810D:</span>&emsp;
  <span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20);">"Start-up approved, cleared to Frankfurt, TOLSI3D departure, climb initally FL50, squawk 6403, Royal Air Maroc 810 Delta."</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <span style="color: rgb(150, 0, 0);">GMMN_DEL:</span>&emsp;
  <span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 Delta, readback correct, report ready for pushback."</span>
  </p>
</div>
</blockquote>

#### Technical Start-up

<p>If a clearance cannot be immediately granted by the controller for any reason, the pilot shall be instructed to standby for clearance. Additionally, the controller may issue 'technical start-up' approval to the pilot, indicating that their start-up request has been approved but the en route clearance is still being processed.</p>

<p>It is important to note that pilots are not authorised to start their engines when positioned at nose-in stands and a separate clearance for pushback is still required. The start-up clearance will be recorded as Estimated Off-Block Time (EOBT). If the start-up clearance cannot be provided within the next 5 minutes, the start-up shall not be approved, and the pilot shall be given the Target Start-Up Approval Time (TSAT).</p>

#### TSAT

<p>In situations of high traffic volume, when a pilot requests start-up, they may receive a Target Start-up Approval Time (TSAT). This TSAT indicates the anticipated time for the pilot to receive approval for start-up/pushback.</p>

<p>If the pilot requests start-up while also requesting the en route clearance, the TSAT will be provided simultaneously. The pilot is responsible for initiating the start-up process by informing the controller when they are ready for start-up.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="text">

  <p>
  <span style="color: rgb(150, 0, 0);">GMMN_DEL:</span>&emsp;
  <span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, start up time at 1415 (TSAT 14:15z), report aircraft ready"</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <span style="color: rgb(150, 0, 0);">RAM810D:</span>&emsp;
  <span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20);">"Wilco, Royal Air Maroc 810 delta"</span>
  </p>

</div>
</blockquote>

The runway will be confirmed either prior to taxi or during the pushback clearance by Ground.</p>

#### Pushback

The pushback direction depends on the location of the aircraft and runway configuration.

Example: <span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, pushback approved, face south, runway 35L”.</span>

#### VFR Aircraft

VFR circuits shall not be permitted at the aerodrome during times of increased IFR departure or arrival activity and shall be permitted only after prior coordination with TWR.

#### Taxiway Usage and Restrictions

Although there are no regulated taxi routes in Casablanca, it is advised that outbound traffic use outer-taxiways and incoming traffic use apron inner-taxiways.

To ensure a smooth taxi flow and avoid conflicting routes, it is recommended to utilise entries and exits in a unidirectional manner.

#### Runway Crossings

To allow sufficient time for receiving clearance to cross the runway, Ground must handoff traffic well before it reaches the holding point of 17L/35R. In order to expedite the flow of traffic, Ground may, subject to coordination and agreement with Tower, issue the runway crossing clearance in the taxi clearance.

In any circumstance, it is expected that Ground will handoff traffic to Tower in advance.

#### Runway Change Procedure

Tower shall provide ample notice to Ground before changing runway configuration. The last departure using the old configuration shall be coordinated between Tower, Ground and Approach.

Aircraft that have already been cleared to taxi using the old configuration shall be re-cleared if they have not already reached the holding point.

## Mohammed V Tower

### General Provisions

The aerodrome controller’s (ADC) callsign, for radio communication and coordination, is "Mohammed V Tower".

Tower is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways and all operations within the Casablanca ATZ below 2 000 ft. 

Tower shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information about VFR flights operating within the aerodrome traffic zone.

### Runway Selection
Tower determines the direction of operations. Runway configurations should not be mixed and arrivals and departures should remain segregated.

Up to a tailwind component of less than or equal to 7 KT, RWY 35R/L is to be used.

### Departure Procedures

As part of the take-off clearance, Tower shall include instructions for the pilot to contact Approach on the designated frequency once airborne.

A conditional clearance is a clearance issued by an air traffic controller which does not become effective until a specified condition has been satisfied. Conditional line up instructions must include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission.

<blockquote>
<span style="color: rgb(120, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, behind the departing company Boeing 737-800, line-up and wait, runway 35L, behind".</span>
</blockquote>

However, if the aircraft ahead is already well clear, the next aircraft may be instructed simply to: “line-up and wait.”

#### Separation Requirements

Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure wake turbulence separation requirements. Departures with the same flow point must be separated by at least 7 NM or the appropriate wake turbulence requirement, whichever is greater. A greater separation needs to be coordinated between the radar controller and TWR. 

All fixed-wing IFR departures with the same TMA flow point shall be transferred to Approach with 7 NM in trail. For separation of 7 NM, the proceeding traffic needs to be 4-5 NM away from the end of the departure runway. If no radar screen is used, two minute separation can be used in this case as well.

If the distance ends up being less than 7 NM but more than 3NM (ensured), coordination is required and avoiding action to be taken by the pilot is given when the controller considers that an imminent risk
a collision will exist if action is not taken immediately.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence or flow separation minima exist.

<blockquote>
<span style="color: rgb(120, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, cleared for takeoff 35R, wind 070 degrees, 12 knots. When airborne contact approach 119.900."</span>
</blockquote>

When traffic is clear of DER (if there is no WTS minima) or the respective minima between the two aircraft, a departure may be cleared for aircraft that do not require separation along the same flow point or a WTS minima greater than 7 NM. However, the controller shall provide traffic information as appropriate to ensure traffic is separated upon TMA entry.

<blockquote>
<span style="color: rgb(120, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, R, wind 070 degrees, 12 knots, proceeding traffic ATR-600".</span>
</blockquote>

ADC shall use caution when departing aircraft with different speed profiles and is fully responsible for ensuring that horizontal or vertical separation exists at all times. It is thus advised that a VFR aircraft on a visual climbout must turn more than 45° from the runway track in order to allow succeeding IFR traffic to depart with separation of less than 3 NM in trail.

#### Cancelling or Stopping a Take-off

IFR departures shall be instructed to contact the radar controller once airborne in the take-off clearance.
When an aircraft has commenced the take-off roll, and it is necessary for the aircraft to abandon take-off in order to avert a dangerous traffic situation, the aircraft should be instructed to stop immediately and the instruction and callsign repeated.

<blockquote>
<span style="color: rgb(120, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, stop immediately, Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, stop immediately".</span>
</blockquote>

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

### Arrival Procedures

The Approach controller is responsible for establishing longitudinal separation between arrivals until touchdown. If they fall below the separation minima, ADC has to instruct the pilot to go around. In this case, coordination with Approach is strongly recommended.

The minimum separation between two aircraft approaching the same runway is always 7 NM or wake turbulence separation, whichever is higher.

If it is apparent that minimum separation is infringed, Tower may apply a speed reduction to maintain in order to ensure separation, however, controllers must use caution as proceeding arrival flows may be inconvenienced. As such, continuous coordination between Approach and Tower is highly recommended.

<blockquote>
<span style="color: rgb(120, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, reduce to minimum approach speed".</span>
</blockquote>

Aircraft may be instructed to maintain their separation visually if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with an agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

#### Missed Approach Instructions

Instructions to carry out a missed approach may be given to avert an unsafe situation. When a missed approach is initiated, cockpit workload is inevitably high. Any transmissions to aircraft going around should be brief and kept to a minimum.

<blockquote>
<span style="color: rgb(120, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, go around".</span>
</blockquote>

Once the traffic has acknowledged the instruction and is observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to the Approach controller.

<blockquote>
<span style="color: rgb(120, 20, 20);">"Royal Air Maroc 810 delta, fly runway heading, climb 4 000 ft, contact Mohammed V Approach 119.9".</span>
</blockquote>

In the case that there is a risk that the go-around aircraft will overtake the departing aircraft, instructions for avoiding action shall be given to the departing aircraft in the form of altitude restrictions. Additionally, if separation is infringed, each aircraft shall receive relevant traffic information, respectively. 

Departures shall not be permitted to commence their take-off roll until separation with go-around traffic is assured.
