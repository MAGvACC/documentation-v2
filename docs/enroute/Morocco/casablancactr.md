# Casablanca Radar (GMMM)

### Coverage

When controlling GMMM_CTR, you have jurisdiction over all the land airports in Morocco. In contrast, GMAC_CTR covers the oceanic sector, and GMMM_ALL_CTR encompasses both the land and oceanic sectors, covering the whole FIR.

### Sector Splits

GMMM_CTR is divided into three sectors on the network, each with its own callsign and frequency.

### Jurisdiction

As stated in the coverage section, if there is no controller assigned to a specific airport below your position, you will assume responsibility for that airport. You have authority over all the airports in a top-down manner unless there is a controller online at a lower position. In that case, the controller below will hand off the aircraft when neccessary.
